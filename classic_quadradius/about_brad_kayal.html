<p class="style1">
I live in Boston, which, according to Google maps, is 303 miles from Allentown.
By day I work as an art director / designer at one of those big advertising agencies you typically find in larger cities.
Outside of that, I'm also a freelance designer ( see also : <a href="http://www.bradkayal.com" target="_blank">www.bradkayal.com</a> ),
as well as a part time music nerd ( <a href="http://www.theinformation.net" target="_blank">www.theinformation.net</a>
and <a href="http://www.49admiral.com" target="_blank">www.49admiral.com</a> ).
<br><br>
Anyway, I met Jimmi in 1995 back in Pennsylvania right about the same time he finished the now infamous Quadradius precursor, "Squares".
Jimmi was the first all-out unabashed computer nerd I had ever met.
I was instantly impressed with his abilities to master all things PC related and still find time to see one of my various
high school punk bands play at various venues around Eastern PA.
<br><br>
Eventually I moved to Philly to get an art degree and then 4 years later, with an art degree in hand
(and the entire dotcom world burning down around me) I moved to Boston to start my design career.
<br><br>
Since then, I've worked mainly on print, and web projects with random altercations with both television and event design for clients like Volkswagen,
Timberland, ESPN, Kangol, and The Truth. I hadn't though, ever done any real design for a video game.
So, when Jimmi approached me about building a new version of "Squares" in Flash that would be played over the internet I was pretty intrigued.
And so from this point on me and Jimmi set out to build the new Squares (aka: QUADRADIUS!).
<br><br>

If you have any suggestions about the game design feel, free to email me at :
