<p class="style1">
	I graduated from Drexel University in Philadelphia Pennsylvania in the summer of 2006.
	This 5 year educational process has lead to me receiving a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, which I have childishly <a href="http://www.quadradius.com/stuff/quadradius/diploma.jpg" target="_blank">defaced</a> and proudly hung on my wall.
	Following graduation, I relocated back to Allentown, Pa, where I am originally from.
	This spec on the map is commonly referred to as the Lehigh Valley.
	It’s about 50 miles north of Philly.
	My foremost creative drive lies in programming, and I enjoy working with Java, ActionScript, C++, and PERL.
	I enjoy equal amounts of back end and front end programming (programming behind-the-scenes code vs graphical user interfaces).
	Originally, I started off programming for stand alone applications, while recently I have been dabbling in coding for the web.
	I am very interested to see the two developing technologies merging together.
	After completing Quadradius, I have acquired a deeper appreciation for networked communications and began exploring the delicate intricacies associated with shared data, synchronization of remote applications, and the HCI and security hurdles it brings. 
<br><br>
	Since I spend a lot of time in front of this modern marvel, the computer, I decided it was in my best interest to make my work environment as efficient and friendly as possible.
	I built an 8’ by 4’ <a href="http://www.quadradius.com/stuff/quadradius/computerDesk.jpg" target="_blank">desk</a>, of which the entire surface is made from white erase board, making note-taking and diagramming dorkishly easy.
	I also invested in 2 dual video cards so I can run four monitors off of one system.
	It makes things like running multiple development and design software very accessible and much smoother to multitask.
	Being able to have multiple programs and test-windows visible all at once is a great enhancement to productivity and nerd bragging rights.
	I was told chicks dig multiple monitor configurations.
<br><br>
	Every summer, I participate in and help organize an annual charity Super Picnic with all of my friends in an event known as <a href="http://www.slaskifest.com" target="_blank">SlaskiFest</a>.
	It is a picnic for one thousand of our closest friends.
	I support my necessities in life with a corporate IT job at an international chemical company here in the Valley called <a href="http://www.airproducts.com" target="_blank">Air Products</a>.
	I am actively getting out of debt, not counting school loans, with my last payment scheduled for summer, 2030.
	As for hanging out and relaxing, I enjoy interesting tech/art conversations, with friends and strangers, over a good drink or three.
<br><br>
	Perhaps now I can play my game, instead of simply writing and testing it.
